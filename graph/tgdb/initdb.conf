# A segment is a physical file allocated on disk. It is specified in GBs.

# Data Segment. They manage data. User specify how many initial segments are needed.

# Transaction Segment. Transaction Write-Ahead logs are maintained as part of the shared memory backed by file.

# The syscipher is used for creating a System-Wide Self Signed Database certificate.

# It can be obtained by running
# $> openssl -V ciphers
